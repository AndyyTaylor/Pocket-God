## Trading Game
*By Andrew Taylor*

***Running the Game***    
You should just be able to navigate to the *main* file in finder *(note this is seperate to the main.cpp file)* and double click on it.     
**This has not been tested**, as such if there are any errors please let me know on the forums. Thanks :)

***Reporting Issues***  
I *greatly appreciate* anyone who both takes the time to try out the game and takes the time to report any errors back to me. That being said, efore doing so, please *make sure your error is not listed below*.

***Known Issues***  
- Height glitch when crossing z boundary of terrain
    - I know why this is but am yet to implement a fix
- Height issues when walking off the terrain entirely
